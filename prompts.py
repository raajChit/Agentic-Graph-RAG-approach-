                        Sensitive geospatial data (e.g., detailed cadastral maps showing exact plot boundaries).
                        Coordinates or layout plans that might reveal strategic locations (especially relevant if the land is close to critical infrastructure or restricted areas).

                        Scenarios where the query or request may require:
                        Sophisticated analysis: Multiple contextual factors must be weighed, or there are competing pieces of evidence/information.
                        Contextual interpretation: The correct response depends on information that isnt easily captured by rules or straightforward data lookups (e.g., legal, ethical, or policy implications).
                        Situational nuances: The query has gray areas or potentially far-reaching consequences, making it more prudent to have human oversight. 
                        If you are told to recommend something or propose something, it is a complex query.
