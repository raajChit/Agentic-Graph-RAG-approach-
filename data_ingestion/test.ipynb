For this, applications are received from various public infrastructure development organizations, as well as private building, professionals, architects. The application for infrastructure from various development organizations is circulated to the Tree Authority officers. In addition, the proposal for cutting of trees coming under development on private land is received from the concerned developer. Before submitting the proposal to the Garden Department, the Building Proposal Department gives permission for the development work against the No Objection Certificate of the Tree Authority. It has been observed that there is delay in this process and due to this development works are getting stuck. Tree Authority dated 5.3.2013\n",

      "Translation: The work is permitted against the No Objection Certificate of the Tree Authority. It has been observed that this procedure causes delay and due to this, development works are stuck. In the meeting of the Tree Authority dated 5.3.2013, it was ordered that the said procedure should be prepared in a loose and implementable manner. After exchanging views on this, the following is proposed. 1. Procedure No. DySG/TA/MC/568 dated 7.10.2006 and Tree Authority&#39;s subject No. 176 Tree Authority dated 7.10.2006 along with resolution No. M.C./6785/ Vrupra dated 7.11.2006 has been passed. 2. Applications received under this Act are received from architects, owners of the site etc. It is found that there is a strong demand for cutting down trees and sometimes for replanting them, but when analyzing the reasons why these trees do not survive, it is found that the replanting is not done in a scientific manner. For this, the concerned developers should consult a qualified plant scientist.\n",

      "Translation: There is an urge to replant trees but while analyzing the reasons why these trees are not surviving, it has been found that the replanting is not done in a scientific manner. For this, the concerned developers have not taken the help of a qualified horticulturalist. Henceforth, all such applications will have to be made through such horticulturalist as per Appendix-1, tree-wise as per Appendix-1. 3. In the case of proposals for cutting/replanting trees under various projects of the Municipal Corporation, the concerned Account Head will prepare a proposal using the above procedure and submit it to the Tree Authority Officer J-17105(1-4) 38 2013. The Tree Authority Officer will submit it to the Tree Authority with his/her feedback within the next 45 working days. 4. In the case of proposals for cutting/replanting trees through government and semi-government institutions, the concerned government institution will prepare a proposal using the above procedure and submit it to the Tree Authority Officer.

Proposals from private developers a) If there is no tree on the plot on which development work is to be done and there is no objection to the proposal being passed by the concerned officers of the Building Proposal Department after taking note of the same. Therefore, such proposals should not be sent to the Tree Authority Officer/Park Superintendent for a No Objection Certificate. b) The registered botanical garden scientist will prepare the information of the trees on the plot on which development work is to be done and there are trees on the same plot but these trees do not obstruct the proposed development work and submit it to the concerned Building Proposal Department as per Appendix &#39;A&#39;.

In this city as well as in such new buildings, the need for trees is more than the need for cars. Every architect should show the existing trees in the map accompanying the application for no objection permit of Mumbai Fire Department and Transport Department, and the recommendation for the need for cutting such trees should be included in the no objection permit issued by the concerned department.

If tree felling is proposed except for the needs of Mumbai Fire Department and parking needs, in such a situation, the concerned developer should see how the building can be designed without cutting the trees and if even then it is felt that cutting the trees is necessary, the following procedure should be followed. The concerned developer/architect should first submit the construction proposal to the Building Proposal Department 3-17105(2) and submit a detailed plan of which and how many trees need to be cut tree-wise through the Botanical Garden Specialist as per Appendix A. In addition, the following two reasons should be given regarding why the relevant trees need to be cut: (1) Detailed reasons for cutting each tree-wise should be given. (2) If the tree is not to be cut, what kind of tree-wise exemption is required should be given. After receiving the proposal as above, the concerned officer of the Building Proposal Department, the circle-wise officer of the Garden Department and the concerned architect will hold a meeting and the concerned developer will submit the detailed plan to the Architect.\n",

After completing all the procedures mentioned in point no. 1 from the date of receipt of the proposal, it will be submitted to the Tree Authority within 45 days. 6) In some cases other than development work, it is necessary to remove or prune trees, the work on which will be as follows: a.

While removing them, it should be ensured that this will be done at the root.
